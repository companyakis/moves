/*

Move code is organized into modules that are uploaded to the Aptos blockchain. Users can interact with the modules by calling functions from these modules via transactions. 
Modules are grouped into packages. When uploading code to the blockchain, an entire package of multiple modules will be uploaded.

Each Move module is a unique identifier that's made up of the address it's deployed at and the module name. 
The fully qualified is of the format <address>::<module_name>. The module name is usually snake_cased by convention.
